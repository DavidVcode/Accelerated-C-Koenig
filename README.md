Academic notes and exercises from "Accelerated C++ Practical Programming by Example" Koenig &amp; E.Moo

This repository is a collection of academic exercises and personal notes from "Accelerated C++ Practical Programming by Example"

The purpose of these exercises are fundamental improvment and understanding the C++ language and programming from a layman's starting point. It is my aim that a slow and gradual accumulation of projects will show a definitive roadmap of progress or, through painpoints, lack of clarity, careful documentation of challenges presented, and my attempted solutions.

Some problems may go unresolved if the resources available to me are insufficient to overcome a particular exercise within a reasonable timeframe. In this event, there will always try to label the individual project as "PROBLEMATIC" or "UNRESOVLED". This is the same procedure as withany exercises from the academic Stroustrup repository.

My goal is the same as to any language learner: to become familiar enough with the basic grammar, structure, definitions, and syntatical variations to achieve the capacity to ask and solve basic questions that are routinely answered in more complex programs. 

There are at least 3 main advantages to the repository:

    Centralized location for all projects that can be accessed from any device
    Proximity to the coding community where it can be cross-examined or modified
    Dedicated repository to seperate it from other types of projects

Observers are welcome to add tips or remarks to help expedite the learning process.
